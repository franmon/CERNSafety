\section{Safety issues}

In this section we review the main issues related with safety when operating and working with the NEXT-DEMO detector evaluating the risk level for all of them. We do not include the issues related with the operation of the magnet.

\subsection{Pressure Risks}

The components that are related with pressure risks are the pressure vessel and the gas system. Both have been operating for about three years with no major problems.

\subsubsection{Pressure Vessel}
The engineering calculations and the hydrostatic test results on the vessel are attached to this document. These documents show that the operation of the NEXT-DEMO pressure vessel is safe and it doesn't represent a risk for its operation.

\subsubsection{Gas system}
The gas system is composed of standard swagelock components, all of them with the european certification for safety (CE mark). The list and scheme of the different components is shown in the correspondind attached documents. The gas system does not represent a significant risk for the operation of the NEXT-DEMO detector.

\subsubsection{Recovery Bottles}

The bottles designed for the cryogenic recovery of the Xenon from the main volume have been tested for pressure and they are safe for operation. The document of such test are included in the attahments.


\subsubsection{Safety systems implemented}
A slow control system has been developed in order to monitor the pressure in different parts of the gas system and pressure vessel. The slow control can start/stop the re-circulation pump and also block the system in case a leak is detected so the gas remains inside the system. The slow control represents an extra help for improving the safety.

Moreover, the gas system has two bursting disks for a controled break in case of over-preassure. One in the vacuum side for protecting the vacuum instruments (turbo molecular pump, RGA,...) and one in the pressure side that breaks at 13 bar to prevent any high over-pressure of the system.

\subsection{Oxygen displacement}

When operating with any gas we need to understand the effect that a total failure of the system will have on the amount of oxygen in the experimental area. The amount of Xenon used in the NEXT-DEMO detector is around 1kg, for our safety estimations we will assume 1.5kg so we are in a very pessimistic scenario.
In case of a big leak in gas system all the Xenon will be liberated into the experimental area. As Xenon is much denser than air it will stay at the bottom side. The height of the volume that Xenon will occupy is defined by the total amount of Xenon and the surface of the experimental area. The volume of 1.5kg of Xenon at 1 bar represents a volume of 8.84 cubic meters. As the surface of the experimental area is 25 square meters, the total height is 0.35 meters. That should not represent any danger for working in the area but oxygen monitors, either individual or general, are recomended to reduce this risk.


\subsection{High Voltage safety}

The high voltage to create the electric field in TPC is generated by two High voltages modules (\textit{FUG HCP 140-100000} and \textit{FUG HCP 0-35000)}. Those modules have a fine tunning potentiometer for both voltage and current, allowing us to limit the total power and current produced byt the module. Moreover, they can be controled remotely using an IP connexion. During normal operation the modules are always controled using a special Slow Control software developed by the IFIC grup using LabView$^{\textcopyright}$ libraries. That prevents any errors in the manipulation of the modules and also helps with fast response in case of any failure.
The documentation related with the modules can be found in the folder "HHV Power Supplies"
Moreover, there is no direct acces to the any point that is at high voltage, all of them will be either inside the detector or inside the modules. That shows that the high voltage operation does not represent a risk for the operation of the detector.


\subsection{Fire}

As the gases used in the operation of NEXT-DEMO are not flamable the only system that is affected by the risk of fire is the electronics. The total power is not very high (see section \ref{sec:ElecPow}) and the electronics has been operating for a long time without any problem, we consider that the risk of having fire in the experimental area is minimum. In case that a extinguisher system is needed we can design a system using extinguishers directly in the electronics racks that are activated using a serie of smoke detectors. In that case we will recommend powder extinguisher as they can be used in the electronics and at the same time they can not produce a problem related with air displacement like the $CO_2$ extinguishers.


\subsection{Cryogenics}

For the recovery of the Xenon to the recovery bottles the use of liquid Nitrogen is needed. The recovery bottles are in a thermally insolated container that on one hand makes the process more efficient and also prevents Nitrogen to spill in the experimental area.

When using liquid Nitrogen indivual protection such as gloves and face protection is required.
