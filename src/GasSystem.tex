\section{Gas system} \label{sec:GasSystem}

The functions of the gas system of NEXT-DEMO are the evacuation of the detector, its pressurization and depressurization with xenon (and argon), and the recirculation of the gas through purification filters. A schematic of the system is shown in figure~\ref{fig:GasSystem}.

The standard procedure during normal operation of the detector starts with the evacuation of the vessel to vacuum levels around $10^{-5}$~mbar. The detector is then filled with xenon gas to pressures up to 10 bar. The xenon can be cryogenically recovered to a stainless-steel bottle (Fig. \ref{fig:RecoB}) connected to the gas system by simply immersing this in a dewar filled with liquid nitrogen. The gas flows inside the bottles and freezes there.
%The pressure regulator of the bottle is fully opened to allow the xenon gas to flow inside it (due to the temperature difference) and freeze.

The vacuum pumping system consists of a roughing pump (Edwards XDS5 scroll vacuum pump) and a turbo molecular pump (Pfeiffer HiPace 300). Vacuum pressures better than $10^{-7}$~mbar have been obtained after pumping out the detector for several days. The recirculation loop is powered by an oil-less, single-diaphragm compressor (KNF PJ24999-2400) with a nominal flow of 100 standard liters per minute. This translates to 
an approximate flow of 10 liters per minute at 10 bar, thus recirculating the full volume of NEXT-DEMO ($\sim45$~L) in about 5 minutes. The gas system is equipped with both room-temperature (SAES MC50) and heated \emph{getters} (SAES PS4-MT15) that remove electronegative impurities (O$_{2}$, H$_{2}$O, etc.) from the xenon. All the gas piping, save for the inlet gas hoses and getter fittings, are $1/2$ inch diameter with VCR fittings. A set of pressure relief valves (with different settings for the various parts of the system) and a burst disk in the vacuum system protect the equipment and personnel from overpressure hazards.

The operation of the gas system (Fig. \ref{fig:GasSystem2}) has been, in general, very stable. The detector has run without interruption for long periods with no leaks and continuous purification of the gas. However, one major leak occurred when the diaphragm of the recirculation pump broke, causing the loss of the xenon volume contained in the chamber. This led to the installation of an emergency mechanism that, in the event of pressure drop, automatically closes those valves connecting the pump to the rest of the gas system. Since installation, only one major failure has taken place which the emergency system isolated without loss of gas.  Micro-leaks, on the level of 0.005 bar per day, due to bad connections in the gas system have also been detected making it necessary to introduce additional xenon to maintain pressure. The micro-leaks where found and properly repaired allowing for a stable detector operation in the last year.

Several improvements to the initial design of the gas system have been made thanks to the initial data runs. These include the recognition of the importance of reliability of the main pump as well as the decision to use hot getters as the main gas purification stage due to their negligible emission of radon compared to that of room-temperature getters.

\subsection{Gas Mixtures}

For the updgrade of NEXT-DEMO++ we will need to operate the detector with a mixture of Xenon with other gas. The gas choosen as a first option is CO$_2$. This gas give us all the advantages of the gas mixtures (improvement in drift velocity, reduction of diffusion,...) at concentrations smaller than 1\% . In order to control the concentration of CO$_2$ the gas system will need a small upgrade consisting in two flow meters and a small bottle of CO$_2$.


\subsection{Technical and safety specifications}

The gas system is made up of standard components. The Getters and the compressor carry CE marks.

Swagelock components do not carry a CE mark. However, all Swagelock
components used comply with the requirement of Article~3, Paragraph~3 of the PED Directive \mbox{(97/23/EC)} and in accordance with that section do not carry a CE mark. Notwithstanding, we can included all the certificates.

The complete list of parts with the associated part numbers is given in attachment "VALCI-MONTI-195". We have also selected a list of major components that is given below, in which we have omitted explicit listing of the standard components such as elbows and similar coupling as they are too numerous and being all manufactured by Swagelock comply with the above mentioned PED directive.
